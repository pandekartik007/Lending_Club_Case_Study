## General Information
In this case study, we will utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine how consumer and loan attributes impact the likelihood of default. By identifying high-risk loan applicants, we can reduce the number of such loans and minimize credit losses. The primary goal of this case study is to pinpoint these at-risk applicants through EDA.
